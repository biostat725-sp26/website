Under this heading you’ll find an entry called Container Manager (CMGR Coursework Containers).\n\nIf the status shows something other than Operational, this means there is a known incident with the containers. Check back later to see if it’s been resolved. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the course forum to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).",

    "text": "Five tips for success\nYour success in this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. Your TA(s) and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TA, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings and other preparation work.\nDo the homeworks. The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities during the lectures. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or any device with internet and a keyboard to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.",

    "section": "Activities & Assessment",
    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on four components: homework, exams, live coding, and application exercises.\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks and explain the underlying mathematics, with a focus on the computation and communication. Homework assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted as a PDF for grading in Gradescope. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. HW0 will not be graded for credit.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will be an open-note take-home assessment. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the applied and mathematical content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The exams will be based on content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and homework assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nLive Coding\nThere will be an in-class live coding evaluation in this course. The exercise will take place on Thursday, April 9, during the regularly scheduled class period, and will account for 10% of the final course grade. Students will work independently in a real-time setting to implement and analyze a Bayesian model using Stan, drawing on concepts from lectures and course assignments. This will be an open-book exercise: students may use course materials and external online resources, but may not use AI tools to generate written explanations or narrative interpretations (AI may be used for coding and technical assistance only). The goal of the exercise is to assess students’ ability to apply Bayesian modeling concepts and work effectively in Stan under realistic analytical conditions. Materials will be distributed at the start of the session via a Github repo. Students who cannot attend on this date must contact the instructor in advance to arrange an alternative. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.\n\n\nApplication exercises\nYou will get the most out of the course if you actively participate in class. Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). AEs are submitted by pushing your work to the relevant GitHub repo. AEs from Tuesday lectures should be submitted by Friday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures should be submitted by Sunday at 11:59p ET. Because AEs are intended for in-class activities, there are no extensions given on AEs.\nAEs will be graded based on making a good-faith effort to attempt all questions covered in class. You are welcome to, but not required, to work on AEs beyond lecture.\nSuccessful on-time effort on at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nDuke Community Standard\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\n\n\n\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:2 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\nAI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\nNo AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, AI is not permitted for writing narrative on assignments. In general, you may use AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback in a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email me at sib2@duke.edu before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your director of graduate studies (DGS) know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your DGS.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the last day of classes.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nEvery student is expected to attend and participate in lecture. There may be times, however, when you cannot attend class. Lecture recordings will be made available upon request for students who have an excused absence. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the material and complete the application exercise, if applicable, before the next lecture.",

It will begin with “ssh-rsa….” R will then ask “Would you like to open a browser now?” Click 1 for yes.\nStep 4: You may be asked to provide your username and password to log into GitHub. This would be the ones associated with your account that you set up. After entering this information, paste the key in and give it a name. You might name it in a way that indicates where the key will be used (e.g., biostat725).\n\n\n\nConfigure git\nThe last thing we need to do is configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.\nTo do so, you will use the use_git_config() function from the usethis package.\nType the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and the email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Your name\", \n  user.email = \"Email associated with your GitHub account\")\n\nFor example, mine would be\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"berchuck\",\n  user.email = \"sib2@duke.edu\")\n\nIt may look like nothing happened but you are now ready interact between GitHub and RStudio! We will begin working with RStudio and GitHub in lecture this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should be using the email address you used to create your GitHub account, it’s ok if it isn’t your Duke email.",

For a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are equal to \\(\\lambda\\). We are interested in performing statistical inference on \\(\\lambda\\) using a Bayesian approach. A frequently used prior for \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(\\text{Gamma}(\\text{shape = }a, \\text{rate = }b)\\), where \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\lambda] = a/b\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}(\\lambda) = a/b^2\\).\n\nExercise 1\nThe researchers have prior knowledge that leads them to believe that \\(\\lambda\\) should have mean 8 and variance 4. What values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) should they specify?\n\n\nExercise 2\nUsing the prior specified in Exercise 1, compute the probability that \\(\\lambda\\) is greater than 11? For this computation compute the exact probability using the pgamma function in R.

Report your Monte Carlo standard error and make sure it is less than 0.01.\n\n\nExercise 4\nSuppose the researchers are interested in the quantity, \\(\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\). Compute the probability that \\(\\alpha\\) is greater than 2.5. Use the same number of Monte Carlo samples as in Exercise 3 and describe why Monte Carlo sampling makes this computation much more efficient than computing the exact probability.\n\n\nExercise 5\nUsing the prior specified in Exercise 1, compute the posterior distribution for \\(\\lambda\\), \\(f(\\lambda | \\mathbf{Y})\\), where \\(\\mathbf{Y}_i = (Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n).\\) Recall that the Gamma prior for \\(\\lambda\\) is a conjugate prior, so that the posterior is given by: \\(f(\\lambda|\\mathbf{Y}) \\sim Gamma(a + \\sum_{i=1}^nY_i,b+n)\\). Visualize the posterior distribution and report the posterior mean and a 95% credible interval. Provide an interpretation of the posterior summaries within the context of the US births data.\n\n\nExercise 6\nWhat is the posterior probability that \\(\\lambda\\) is greater than 11? This is equivalent to computing \\(P(\\lambda &gt; 11 | \\mathbf{Y})\\). Again, use Monte Carlo sampling. Provide an interpretation for this probability in the context of hospital visits.\n\n\nExercise 7\nCreate a figure that includes both the prior and posterior distributions for \\(\\lambda\\). Also, include a figure of the observed data. Use these figures to make a comparison of the prior and posterior probabilities found in Exercise 3 and Exercise 6, respectively. Describe any changes in these two probabilities and how they relate to the observed data."

It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOpen the Quarto (.qmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nNow, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Quarto (.qmd) file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\nIf you’re happy with these changes, we’ll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “updated author name”) in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments we may tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\n\n\nPush changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed. Click on Push.\nNow let’s make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you’re good to go!"
