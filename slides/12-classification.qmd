## Review of last lecture

-   Last week, we learned about Bayesian approaches to robust regression and regularization.

    -   Global-local shrinkage priors.

-   This week, we will focus on classification models.

    -   Today: Binary classification (logistic regression).

    -   Thursday: Multiclass classification (multinomial, ordinal regression).

## Models for binary outcomes

-   **Bernoulli** random variable: Used for binary outcomes (success/failure), e.g., whether a patient responds to a treatment (yes/no).

-   **Binomial** random variable: Used when there are multiple trials (e.g., 10 patients), and you want to model the number of successes (e.g., how many out of 10 patients experience a treatment response).

## Bernoulli random variable example

A **Bernoulli random variable** represents a random variable with two possible outcomes: 0 or 1.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a medical study on a new drug for hypertension (high blood pressure). You want to model whether a patient responds positively to the treatment.

-   **Success (1)**: The patient’s blood pressure decreases significantly (e.g., more than 10% reduction).

-   **Failure (0)**: The patient does not experience a significant decrease in blood pressure.

## Binomial random variable example

A **Binomial random variable** represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.

**Scenario:**

A clinical trial is conducted where 10 patients are given a new drug for diabetes. You want to model how many of these 10 patients experience a significant reduction in their blood sugar levels (e.g., a decrease by at least 20%).

-   Each patient’s outcome is a Bernoulli random variable: success (1) if their blood sugar level decreases, failure (0) if it does not.

-   The total number of successes (patients who experience a reduction) is modeled as a **Binomial random variable**.

## Models for binary outcomes

-   Suppose $Y_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$ for $i = 1,\ldots,n$. The pmf is,

$$f(Y_i) = P(Y_i = y) = \pi_i^y (1 - \pi_i)^{1 - y}, \quad y \in\{0,1\}.$$

-   We only need to specify $\pi_i = P(Y_i = 1)$.

-   One strategy might be to simply fit a linear regression model,

$$Y_i = \alpha + \mathbf{x}_i \boldsymbol{\beta} + \epsilon_i,\quad\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2).$$

-   We can set $P(Y_i = 1) = \hat{Y}_i$.

## Primary biliary cirrhosis

-   The Mayo Clinic conducted a trial for primary biliary cirrhosis, comparing the drug D-penicillamine vs. placebo. Patients were followed for a specified duration, and their status at the end of follow-up (whether they died) was recorded.

-   Researchers are interested in predicting whether a patient died based on the following variables:

    -   ascites: whether the patient had ascites (1 = yes, 0 = no)

    -   bilirubin: serum bilirubin in mg/dL

    -   stage: histologic stage of disease (ordinal categorical variable with stages 1, 2, 3, and 4)

## What can go wrong?

-   Suppose we fit the following model:

\begin{align*}
Y_i &= \alpha + \beta_1(ascites)_i + \beta_2(bilirubin)_i\\
&\quad+\beta_3(stage = 2)_i + \beta_4(stage = 3)_i\\
&\quad+\beta_5(stage = 4)_i + \epsilon_i,\quad \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)
\end{align*}

. . .

**What can go wrong?**

## What can go wrong?

## What can go wrong?

-   Additionally, as a probability, $P(Y_i = 1)$ must be in the interval \[0, 1\], but there is nothing in the model that enforces this constraint, so that you could be estimating probabilities that are negative or that are greater than 1!

## From probabilities to log-odds

-   Suppose the **probability** of an event is $\pi$.

-   Then the **odds** that the event occurs is $\frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}$.

-   Taking the (natural) log of the odds, we have the **logit** of $\pi$: the **log-odds**:

$$\text{logit}(\pi) = \log\left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right).$$

-   Note that although $\pi$ is constrained to lie between 0 and 1, the logit of $\pi$ is unconstrained - it can be anything from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.

## Logistic regression model

-   Let's create a model for the logit of $\pi$: $\text{logit}(\pi_i)= \eta_i$, where $\eta_i = \alpha + \mathbf{x}_i \boldsymbol{\beta}.$

-   This is a linear model for a transformation of the outcome of interest, and is also equivalent to,

$$\pi_i = \frac{\exp(\eta_i)}{1 + \exp(\eta_i)} = \text{expit}(\eta_i).$$

-   The expression on the right is called a **logistic function** and cannot yield a value that is negative or a value that is \>1. Fitting a model of this form is known as **logistic regression**.

## Logistic regression

$$\text{logit}(\pi_i) = \log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}\right) = \eta_i$$

-   Negative logits represent probabilities less than one-half.

    -   $\eta_i < 0 \implies \pi_i < 0.5$.

-   Positive logits represent probabilities greater than one-half.

    -   $\eta_i > 0 \implies \pi_i > 0.5$.

## Interpreting parameters in logistic regression

Typically we interpret functions of parameters in logistic regression rather than the parameters themselves.

For the simple model: $\log\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i}\right) = \alpha + \beta X_{i},$ we note that the probability that $Y_i = 1$ when $X_i = 0$ is

$$P(Y_i = 1 | X_{i} = 0) = \frac{\exp(\alpha)}{1 + \exp(\alpha)}.$$

## Interpreting parameters in logistic regression

-   Suppose that $X$ is a binary (0/1) variable (e.g., $X = 1$ for males and 0 for non-males).

    -   In this case, we interpret $\exp(\beta)$ as the **odds ratio** (OR) of the response for the two possible levels of $X$.

    -   For $X$ on other scales, $\exp(\beta)$ is interpreted as the odds ratio of the response comparing two values of $X$ one unit apart.

-   Why?

## Interpreting parameters in logistic regression

-   The log odds of response for $X = 1$ is given by $\alpha + \beta$, and the log odds of response for $X = 0$ is $\alpha$.

-   So the odds ratio of response comparing $X = 1$ to $X = 0$ is given by $\frac{\exp(\alpha + \beta)}{\exp(\alpha)} = \exp(\beta)$.

-   In a \emph{multivariable logistic regression} model with more than one predictor, this OR is interpreted conditionally on values of other variables (i.e., controlling for them).

## Bayesian logistic regression

-   We start with observations $Y_i \in \{0,1\}$ for $i = 1,\ldots,n$, where $Y_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$, $\pi_i = P(Y_i = 1)$.

-   The log-odds are modeled as $\text{logit}(\pi_i) = \alpha + \mathbf{x}_i \boldsymbol{\beta} = \eta_i$.

-   To complete the Bayesian model specification, we must place priors on $\alpha$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.

    -   All priors we have discussed up-to-this point apply!

-   Historically, this was a difficult model to fit, but can be easily implemented in Stan.

## Logistic regression in Stan

    log_lik[i] = bernoulli_logit_lpmf(Y[i] | alpha + X_centered[i, ] * beta);
  }

## Back to the PBC data

-   Fitting a logistic regression model, we obtain

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
out <- rstan::summary(fit, pars = c("alpha", "beta"), probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))
out <- out[[1]]
out <- data.frame(out)
out <- out[, c(1, 2, 4, 6)]
out <- cbind(c("intercept", "ascites", "bilirubin", "stage == 2", "stage == 3", "stage == 4"), out)
colnames(out) <- c("variable", "mean", "sd", "2.5%", "97.5%")
knitr::kable(out, digits = 2)
```

-   How might we interpret these coefficients as odds ratios?

## Back to the PBC data {.small}

-   Remember, we are interested in the probability that a patient died during follow-up (a "success"). We are predicting the log-odds of this event happening.

    -   The posterior mean for ascites was 2.24. Thus, the odds ratio for dying is $\exp(2.24) \approx 9.40$. That is, patients with ascites have 9 times the odds of dying compared to patients that do not, holding all other variables constant.

    -   The posterior mean for bilirubin was 0.38. Thus, the odds ratio for dying for a patient with 1 additional mg/dL serum bilirubin compared to another is $\exp(0.38) \approx 1.46$, holding all other variables constant.

    -   The baseline stage was 1. The posterior mean for stage 3 was 2.26. Thus, patients in stage 3 have approximately 9.58 times the odds of dying compared to patients that do not, holding all other variables constant.

## Predicted probabilities

-   There is a one-to-one relationship between $\pi$ and $\text{logit}(\pi)$. So, if we predict $\text{logit}(\pi)$, we can "back-transform" to get back to a predicted probability.

```{stan output.var = "pred", eval = FALSE}
// stored in logistic_regression_new.stan
data {
  row_vector[p] X_new;
}
generated quantities {
  real eta_new = (alpha + (X_new - X_bar) * beta);
  real pi_new = inv_logit(eta_new); // expit function
  real Y_new = bernoulli_logit_rng(eta_new); // posterior predictive distribution
}
```

## Predicted probabilities

-   For instance, suppose a patient does not have ascites, has a bilirubin level of 5 mg/dL, and is a stage 2 patient.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
compiled_model <- stan_model(file = "logistic_regression_new.stan")
stan_data <- list(n = nrow(pbc),
                  p = ncol(X),
                  Y = Y,
                  X = X,
                  X_new = c(0, 5, 1, 0, 0))
fit <- sampling(compiled_model, data = stan_data)
```

## Predicted probabilities

-   For instance, suppose a patient does not have ascites, has a bilirubin level of 5 mg/dL, and is a stage 2 patient.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
print(fit, pars = c("eta_new", "pi_new", "Y_new"), probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))
```

## Predicted probabilities

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
#| layout-ncol: 1
library(ggplot2)
log_odds <- rstan::extract(fit, pars = "eta_new")$eta_new
pi <- rstan::extract(fit, pars = "pi_new")$pi_new
dat_fig <- data.frame(
  Value = c(log_odds, pi),
  Type = rep(c("Log-odds", "Predicted probability"), each = length(pi))
)
ggplot(dat_fig, aes(x = Value)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(. ~ Type, scales = "free_x") + 
  labs(y = "Count")
  
```

-   Posterior mean of the predicted probabilities is `r round(mean(pi), 2)`.

## Posterior predictive checks

```

ppc_stat(stan_data$Y, y_pred, stat = "q025")
ppc_stat(stan_data$Y, y_pred, stat = "q975")
```

## Model comparison

-   Comparing our model to a baseline that removed stage.

```{r}
library(loo)
log_lik <- loo::extract_log_lik(fit, parameter_name = "log_lik", merge_chains = TRUE)
log_lik_baseline <- loo::extract_log_lik(fit_baseline, parameter_name = "log_lik", merge_chains = TRUE)
waic_model <- loo::waic(log_lik)
waic_model_baseline <- loo::waic(log_lik_baseline)

###Make a comparison
comp_waic <- loo::loo_compare(list("full" = waic_model, "baseline" = waic_model_baseline))
print(comp_waic, digits = 2, simplify = FALSE)
```

## Other models for binary data {.midi}

An alternative approach is **Probit regression**, where we use the CDF of the standard normal distribution instead of the logit link: $\Phi^{-1}(\pi) = \alpha + \beta X$

Where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse normal CDF (also called the **probit link function**).

```{stan output.var = "probit", eval = FALSE}
data {
  int<lower = 1> n;               // number of observations
  int<lower = 1> p;               // number of predictors
  int<lower = 0, upper = 1> Y[n]; // binary outcome (0 or 1)
  matrix[n, p] X;                 // design matrix (predictors)
}
parameters {
  real alpha;               // intercept
  vector[p] beta;           // coefficients
}

model {
  target += bernoulli_lpmf(Y | Phi(alpha + X * beta)); // Probit model
}
```

## Steps to selecting a Bayesian GLM

1.  Identify the support of the response distribution.

2.  Select the likelihood by picking a parametric family of distributions with this support.

3.  Choose a link function $g$ that transforms the range of parameters to the whole real line.

4.  Specify a linear model on the transformed parameters.

5.  Select priors for the regression coefficients.

## Example of selecting a Bayesian GLM

1.  Support: $Y_i \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$.

2.  Likelihood family: $Y_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)$.

3.  Link: $g(\lambda_i) = \log(\lambda_i) \in (−\infty, \infty)$.

4.  Regression model: $\log(\lambda_i) = \alpha + \mathbf{x}_i \boldsymbol{\beta}$.

5.  Priors: $\alpha, \beta_j \sim N(0, 10^2)$.
